  # CLIP batch size per synchronous inference step.
  # Batch size must be divisible by n_workers (GPU count)
  # so that it can be shared among workers, and must be a divisor
  # of n_envs * episode_length so that all batches can be of the
  # same size (no support for variable batch size as of now.)
